# SITUA
Making this project for my university as well as using it as a tool to learn Django and testing.
Finally Got CircleCI to work...
The problem was that it initially had old faulty dependencies, which it cached.
Running it again with the proper config file as well as clearing the cache has resolved the problem and saved the working cache.
